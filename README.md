All of the code in this repository is for Arduino.

But if you want to sell or do something with the software or hardware then it'd be nice to include my name and link to my Github somewhere :)


This is a general repository for any and all eurorack modules that i have designed.
I also put DIY stuff here that I made PCB's from some other designers schematic. For example the MFOS PCB.
