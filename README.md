But if you want to sell or do something with the software or hardware then it'd be nice to include my name and link to my Github somewhere :)


This is a general repository for any and all eurorack modules that i have designed.
I also put DIY stuff here that I made PCB's from some other designers schematic. For example the MFOS PCB.
