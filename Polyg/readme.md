>ATTENTION BUILDERS THAT GOT THE FIRST BATCH OF 10 PCB'S(you can tell if they're part of that batch if they have no 'Version 1.1' written on them), THERE WAS A MAJOR ERROR IN THE SILKSCREEN DUE TO ME BEING AN IDIOT, SEE THE FOLDER CALLED 'WRONG SILKSCREEN' AND REFER TO THE 'BUILD MANUAL - WRONG SILKSCREEN' FOR CORRECT COMPONENT NUMBERING IN THE SCHEMATIC AND BOARD FILES FOR YOUR PCB VERSION

8 Voice polyphonic synthesizer with selectable Karplus strong(8 voice plucky string synth) or a 8 voice FM synth with square,sine,triangle and sawtooth. It has a basic FM(techincally Phase Modulation, like the DX7) with one Modulator. 
There's an index knob to set the ratio, decay for the operator and the amount of FM applied.

Current hardware uses a high quality 16bit/44.1kHz DAC(CD4334).


It has MIDI IN and MIDI OUT/THRU. It uses the Arturia Standard for DIN to stereo jack, so type B midi.
You can find adapters in almost every synthstore now.

## Where/how to order
I won't have any PCB's in stock any time soon. This project is pretty much abandoned.
You have my approval of making your own, just remember to credit me.
