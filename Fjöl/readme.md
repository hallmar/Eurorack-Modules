# Fjöl 4-Voice Midi synth

<p align="center"><img src="Fjöl/Documentation/fjöl.png"  width="120" height="360"></p>

Current hardware uses a high quality 16bit/44.1kHz DAC(CD4334).


It has MIDI IN and MIDI OUT/THRU. It uses the Arturia Standard for DIN to stereo jack, so type B midi.
You can find adapters in almost every synthstore now.
