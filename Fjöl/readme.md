# Fjöl 4-Voice Midi synth

<p align="center"><img src="/Fjöl/Documentation/fjöl.jpg"  width="543" height="761"></p>

Current hardware uses a high quality DAC(PCM5100) with 16bit/44.1kHz quality.


It has MIDI IN and MIDI OUT/THRU. It uses the Arturia Standard for DIN to stereo jack, so type B midi.
You can find adapters in almost every synthstore now.
